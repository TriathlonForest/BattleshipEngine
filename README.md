I am learning how to do unit testing in JavaScript with Mocha and Chai, based on a tutorial I found on YouTube.

I figured it would be good to learn this stuff in a tutorial, before I apply it to my real project. That way I can mess up the tutorial project while I am learning
how to use Mocha and Chai, then at the end of the tutorial, I should know how they work, so I don't mess up my real project.

The tutorial is found on YouTube at

I do not take credit for this code. I borrowed it from Traversy Media.
